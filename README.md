# Particle Simulation  

ðŸ§ª Numerical simulations of particles under various physical forces.  

This repository contains Python-based simulations of particles subjected to different forces, such as **gravity** and **arbitrary potentials**. The goal is to explore numerical methods for solving physical systems and visualize dynamic behaviors.  

ðŸš€ **Features:**  
- Simulation of particles under gravitational and custom potentials  
- Numerical integration methods (Euler, Runge-Kutta, etc.)  
- Visualization of particle trajectories  

ðŸ”§ **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib  

ðŸ“Œ Work in progress! Contributions and discussions are welcome.
